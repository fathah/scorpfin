There is a maximum supply of 1 Quadrillion SCORPFIN tokens. 2% of these tokens have 
been allocated to incentivize usage of the merchant network. 
Several rewards initiatives will be launched that will compensate users of the Scorpion merchant 
network with SCORPFIN tokens.
<br />
  The main reason we created the ScorpFin token is for fundraising our project. 
One of the primary benefits of holding our SCORPFIN token is that you will be able 
to use it in the ScorpFin app for everyday Purchases.
<br />
The Scorpion Finance token (SCORPFIN) will play a critical role in how the ScorPay application functions.
