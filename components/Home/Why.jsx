  There is rising demand for both self-hosted wallet solutions and access to 
  diverse solutions. ScorpFin encompasses the qualities of a secure 
  self-hosted wallet, a DEX, a merchant payment network, and a DeFi services 
  aggregator within a single application. Grounded in a frictionless 
  UX and robust security, ScorpFin aims to be the leading wallet solution for 
  cryptocurrency veterans and newcomers alike.
<p  className="text-gray-400 mt-2" data-aos="fade-up">
The ScorpFin team will initially roll out the ScorpFolio and a sophisticated 
wallet solution that facilitates rarely seen features like NFT storage 
and display in future. In future releases, cross-chain atomic swaps, 
a merchant payment network, and the ability to link with DeFi solutions 
will all be integrated. Every feature is subject to a rigorous testing 
process before being implemented to ensure maximum security.
